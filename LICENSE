Database Agreement
==================

Fair Dealings License

**You may use the databases in packaged releases under the following terms.**

1) DEFINITIONS.  You understand and acknowledge that definitions of "Analysis" and
   "Training" are inherently different.  You understand and acknowledge that by
   definition, analytical techniques themselves do not produce Copyrighted works instead
   only independent facts and statistics, whereas training creates compilations and
   collections of information derived from the Copyrighted works being processed.  You
   understand & acknowledge that performing research activities in the "private sector"
   does not necessarily imply the right to commercialize direct outputs of the research.

2) ASSESSMENT.  You understand and acknowledge that instances of "Fair Dealing" must by
   definition be assessed independently for each application, for each of its stages,
   and for each group of rightsholders.  You agree not to claim broad exceptions that
   apply to all applications, all stages, and all rightsholders as it would be
   incompatible with the Berne Convention — which you hereby commit to respecting
   directly regardless of your jurisdiction.  You understand and acknowledge that Fair
   Dealing, if applicable, only provides exceptions to Reproduction rights under ©.

3) RESPONSIBILITIES.  You understand & acknowledge that "Training" in machine learning
   — and particularly for generative models — most often requires the use of protected
   Expressions as well as private information.  You hereby agree it's your
   responsibility to use reasonable efforts and ensure that industry-standard
   precautions during training are taken (e.g. deduplication of training material,
   removal of all names for privacy) and hereby accept that you are liable for this if
   it's is not the case.

4) CONSEQUENCES.  You understand and acknowledge that your artivities when using
   protected works must not conflict with a normal exploitation of the work or
   unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interests of the author, and that it's your
   responsibility to ensure that is the case with rightsholders.  You understand and
   acknowledge that you are expected to have conducted this assessment before beginning
   your activities, and you hereby accept that the burden of proof is on you to prove
   this when challenged.


You may use `weboptout` without the packaged databases if you don't agree with this Fair
Dealings License.  From the moment of first use of the databases you are bound by these
terms and in perpetuity.  To revoke these terms retroactively, written permission is
required from the Author(s) of `weboptout` and a license fee of €250,000.  Failure to
comply with the terms is considered a breach, and the damages are hereby set to the price
of the license at €250,000.
